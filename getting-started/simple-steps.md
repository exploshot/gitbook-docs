# Simple Steps

To improve your understanding, please make yourself familiar with blockchain [terminology](terminology.md). Below is essentially a checklist of tasks you have to do to get started with Qwertycoin.

## Wallet Address and Critical Information

A user must generate a wallet address in order to use QWC blockchain from available QWC wallets. There are various types of wallets you can choose including [Paper wallet](https://paper-wallet.md/), [CLI wallet](../wallet/cli-wallet.md), [GUI wallet](../wallet/gui-wallet.md), [Web wallet](../wallet/web-wallet.md) and [Mobile wallet](../wallet/mobile-wallet.md).  
  
Make sure to keep a record of the following information before using the blockchain.  
1. Private Key \(Critical\)  
2. Mnemonic Seeds \(Critical\)  
3. Wallet Address  
4. Wallet File \(Not provided by Paper Wallet\)  
  
The information marked \(Critical\) shall not be shared with anyone but yourself. If you lost both critical information and wallet file, you are not able to gain access to your funds stored in respective wallet address.   
  
**At all times, do not private key or mnemonic seeds with anyone.**
